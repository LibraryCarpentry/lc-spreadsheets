## Software 

To interact with spreadsheets, we can use
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org), [Microsoft
Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel),
[Gnumeric](https://www.gnumeric.org),
[OpenOffice.org](https://www.openoffice.org), or other programs.
Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for
thinking about spreadsheets is the same.

For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you
